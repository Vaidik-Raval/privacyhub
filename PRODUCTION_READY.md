- [x] Middleware optimization (39.4 kB)
- [x] Code splitting and lazy loading

## ‚úÖ OpenNext Cloudflare Configuration
- [x] wrangler.jsonc correctly configured for Workers
- [x] Compatibility flags: `nodejs_compat`, `global_fetch_strictly_public`
- [x] Compatibility date: 2024-09-23 (required for OpenNext)
- [x] OpenNext config file: open-next.config.ts
- [x] Local development initialization in next.config.ts
- [x] .dev.vars.example created for local development
- [x] Static assets binding configured (.open-next/assets)
- [x] Worker self-reference service binding

## ‚úÖ Deployment
- [x] GitHub integration for automatic deployment
- [x] Environment variables configured in Cloudflare dashboard
- [x] D1 database bound to worker (binding: an-db)
- [x] Build command: `npm run build` (runs Next.js build + OpenNext transformation)
- [x] Deploy command: `wrangler deploy`
- [x] Build artifacts: .open-next/worker.js and .open-next/assets/

## ‚úÖ Monitoring & Debugging
- [x] Console logging for key operations
- [x] Error logging with context
- [x] Database operation status logs
- [x] API call tracking logs
- [x] Cache hit/miss logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Cloudflare Workers Specific
- Rate limiting currently disabled (MVP decision)
- No application-level analytics (relies on Cloudflare Analytics)
- Local development requires .dev.vars file (not .env.local)
- Workers have 30s CPU time limit on free plan (30s/50s/unlimited on paid)
- 3 MiB worker size limit on free plan, 10 MiB on paid plans
- Playwright browser automation may have size constraints on Workers
- OpenNext does not support Edge Runtime (only Node.js runtime)

## üöÄ Ready for Cloudflare Workers Production

All critical production requirements are met. The application is:
- ‚úÖ Migrated from Vercel to Cloudflare Workers
- ‚úÖ OpenNext Cloudflare adapter properly configured
- ‚úÖ Secure and stable with production-grade error handling
- ‚úÖ Performant and scalable on Workers infrastructure
- ‚úÖ No Vercel-specific code remaining
- ‚úÖ Ready for Cloudflare Workers deployment via GitHub

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Copy environment variables template
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# 2. Fill in your API keys in .dev.vars

# 3. Run local development server
npm run dev

# 4. Test Workers runtime locally
npm run worker:preview
```

### Deployment Process

**Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
- Push to `worker` branch
- Cloudflare automatically runs: `npm run build` ‚Üí `wrangler deploy`

**Option 2: Manual Deployment**
```bash
npm run deploy
# or
npm run worker:deploy
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. ‚úÖ Visit the worker URL and run a privacy policy analysis
2. ‚úÖ Check Cloudflare Workers logs for errors (dashboard or `wrangler tail`)
3. ‚úÖ Verify D1 database is auto-initialized on first request
4. ‚úÖ Test the results permalink sharing functionality
5. ‚úÖ Confirm API key rotation works under load
6. ‚úÖ Check `/api/credits` endpoint for key health status
7. ‚úÖ Verify homepage screenshots are captured correctly
8. ‚úÖ Test all API endpoints (/api/analyze, /api/history, /api/credits)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- Rate limiting currently disabled (MVP decision)
- No application-level analytics (relies on Cloudflare Analytics)
- Local development requires .env.local file

## üöÄ Ready for Production

All critical production requirements are met. The application is:
- Secure and stable
- Performant and scalable
- Properly error-handled
- Ready for Cloudflare Workers deployment

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. Visit the worker URL and run an analysis
2. Check Cloudflare Workers logs for errors
3. Verify D1 database is auto-initialized
4. Test the results permalink sharing
5. Confirm API key rotation works under load
